    <h2>Lore</h2>
    <h3>The Dark Portal</h3>
    <p>At the end of the original game the Dark Portal was opened by Lord
    Kazzak. Lord Kazzak opened the portal to the Outlands to join forces with
    Illidan Stormrage (who has taken demon blood to infiltrate their forces and
    destroy the legion) and his two partners Lady Vashj (Queen of the Naga) and Kael'thas
    Sunstrider (Blood Elf ruler). Unfortunately for Lord Kazzak and the rest of
    the Burning Legion the citizens of Azeroth followed the demons into the
    Outlands.</p>
    <h3>The Draenei Comes to Azeroth</h3>
    <p>When Illidan and his army came to Outlands, the draenei were lesss than
    happy. Illidan took some of the Draenei and mutated them to be apart of his
    army, however the rest of the Draenei decided to flee. They took the Exodar
    which was part of a Naaru ship and crash landed in Azeroth. Once in Azeroth
    the Draenei pledged their allegiance to the Alliance. The reason they chose
    the Alliance over the Horde is because of bad blood between the Draenei and
    the Orcs. Back on their homeworld Draenor the Orcs killed many Draenei.</p>
    <h3>The Blood Elves</h3>
    <p>Before Outlands the Blood Elves were members of the Alliance, however
    after the Draenei exposed what some Blood Elves and their leader, Kael'thas
    Sunstrider, were doing the Blood Elves were ostrasized from the Horde. The
    Blood Elves decided to take up arms with the Horde. However, even there they
    were viewed with suspicion by all but the Undead. Lady Sylvana's (Queen of
    the Undead) embraced them because she used to be their high elven queen.
    <h3>What awaits in Outlands</h3>
    <p>Illidan has been wreaking havoc in the Outlands, he has been rallying an
    amry of demon hunters, fel orcs (Orcs who were left behind in the exodus
    from Draenor to Azeroth), and enslaved Broken (Draenei who were left behind
    when the others escaped to Azeroth).</p>
