    <h1>Wrath of the Lich King</h1>
    <p>While the people of Azeroth were worried about the Burning Legion a new
    threat was arising in Northrend. The Lich King emerged from Icecrown Citadel
    ready to conquer Azeroth with his army of the Scourge. Players are now able
    to quest in Northrend and level up to 80.</p>

    <h2>New Classes</h2>
    <p>While there are no new races this expansion there is an exciting new
    class that can be played on any race, the Death Knight. Unlike all
    characters previously introduced in the game, when starting a Death Knight
    the player is automatically started at level 58. During the started quests
    players play under Arthas, The Lich King's rule, only to battle against him
    and his Scourge to join the Alliance or Horde at the end of the starter
    quest line. Death Knight can be played in Frost (dps), Unholy (dps), or

    <h2>Lore</h2>
    <h3>Who is the Lich King</h3>
    <p>The original Lich King was Ner'zhul, or a part of him. Ner'zhul was
    oroginally the leader of the Draenor orcs, but that changed when he
    encournterd one of the demon lords, Kil'jaeden. Ner'zhul tried to escape
    from the Burning Legion's hold, but Kil'jaeden did not let him escape and
    punished him with a fate worse than death. Kil'jaeden servered Ner'zhul's
    spirit from his body and his soul became the entity known as the Lich King.
    The Lich King was originally created to be a tool for the Burning
    Legion.</p>
    <h3>The New Lich King</h3>
    <p>Because the Lich King contained Ner'zhul's spirit it had a mind of its
    own, and eventually broke free of the Legion's control with the purpose of
    destroying Azeroth. Ner'zhul needed a body for his Lich King soul. Ner'zhul
    chose a human by the name of Arthas. Arthas ended up over powering Ner'zhul
    and effectively killing his spirit that remained in the Lich King entity,
    leaving just Arthas who know blamed complete Azeroth destructin</p>
    <h3>The Death Knight</h3>
    <p>Arthas needed an army and used his undead Scourge as that source. The
    Death Knight class is part of the army. In the early introductory quests
    players do Arthas's dirty work, killing the people of Northrend and them
    bringing them back as the Scourge. The players Death Knight after seeing
    these atrocities however, cannot continue to follow Arthas and so the player
    defects to help the Horde/Alliance battle against Arthas's army.</p>
    <h3>What awaits in Northrend</h3>
    <p>Players will enter Northrend either in the Howling Fjord (Horde) or the Borean
    Tundra (Alliance). From there they will fight back against the plague that
    Arthas has created.</p>

    <h2>Raids</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><u>The Nexus (The Eye of Eternity)</u>: From within the safety of his
        personal domain, the Eye of Eternity, Malygos coordinates a crusade to
        reestablish his dominance over the arcane energies coursing through
        Azeroth. In his eyes, the foolish actions of the Kirin Tor and other
        mortal magi have plunged the world into chaos, and the abuse of their
        powers will no longer be tolerated. Threatened by the Spell-Weaver's
        brutal tactics, the Kirin Tor has allied itself with the red
        dragonflight. Together, the two groups closely observe Malygos,
        searching for a way to thwart his campaign and strike out at the Aspect
        of Magic, but thus far the elusive Spell-Weaver has proven difficult to
        engage.</li>
      <li><u>Ulduar</u>: Since discovering Ulduar in the Storm Peaks, adventurers have
        journeyed to the titan city to learn more about its mysterious past.
        Further exploration has revealed that the magnificent complex is above
        all a prison, intended to permanently confine the Old God of death,
        Yogg-Saron. This ancient horror has corrupted its guards, and now it is
        breaking through the last of its restraints.</li>
      <li><u>Naxxramas</u>: Years ago, the crypt lord Anub'arak led an army of undead
        warriors into the ancient nerubian ziggurat now known as Naxxramas. The
        Scourge forces overran the citadel, and under the will of the Lich King
        its corridors were transformed into a potent war machine. Dark magic
        tore the fortress from its subterranean home and lifted it into the sky.
        Hidden behind a thick layer of clouds, Naxxramas grew in strength. At
        the Lich King's bidding, the burgeoning wrath within the necropolis was
        unleashed upon the world. Brave heroes breached the citadel and
        eventually overcame Naxxramas' vile commander, the lich Kel'Thuzad, but
        the victory was short-lived.</li>
      <li><u>The Obsidian Sanctum</u>: More than ten thousand years ago, the black
        Dragon Aspect, Neltharion, began a quest to reign supreme over his
        fellow dragons and thereby dominate Azeroth. Before Deathwing -- as
        Neltharion came to be known -- could achieve his goal, the other Aspects
        drove him into hiding, but the rest of the black dragonflight continued
        his foul work. Hated and hunted for its evil deeds, the black flight
        dwindled, and at first Deathwing schemed to bolster its ranks. In time,
        however, his agents began experimenting with other dragonflights to
        create a new and mightier breed of dragon.</li>
      <li><u>The Ruby Sanctum</u>: The sacred Chamber of the Aspects beneath Wyrmrest
        Temple has seen kingdoms and armies rise and fall throughout history.
        For over ten millennia, the dragonflights' five sanctums have remained
        hallowed ground for dragonkind, undamaged by the chaos of the Sundering
        and protected from the ravages of the Scourge thanks to a rare instance
        of cooperation between members of all five dragonflights.</li>
      <li><u>Trial of the Crusader</u>: Clouds blanket the skies of Icecrown and heroes
        gather beneath battle-worn banners in preparation for the coming storm.
        They say that even the darkest cloud has a silver lining. It is this
        hope that drives the men and women of the Argent Crusade: hope that the
        Light will see them through these trying times, hope that good will
        triumph over evil, hope that a hero blessed by the Light will come forth
        to put an end to the Lich King's dark reign.</li>
      <li><u>Icecrown citadel:</u> Icecrown Citadel dominates Northrend - visible from
        farther away than nearly any other structure and home to the greatest
        army of undead in the known world. Inside dwells the Lich King - a
        tyrant with nearly godlike power over his tireless, seemingly infinite
        subjects - and the will to bring Azeroth to its knees.</li>
    </ul>
