    <h1>Mists of Pandaria</h1>
    <p>After the Shattering and the defeat of Deathwing the Horde and Alliance
    are more at odds than ever, and now both are fighting to conquer the
    uncharted land of Pandaria. Pandaria is home to the Pandaren. In this
    expansion players will be able to level to 90, quest in Pandaria, and play
    as one new class, and play as one new races</p>

    <h2>New Race</h2>
    <p>Players can now play as one of the natives of Pandaria. Pandaren are
    different than the other races as they can be both Horde and Alliance. Once
    the player has gone through all of the Pandaren starter quests they can
    choose which faction they would like to join. Pandaren are the only race
    that cannot be a death knight.</p>

    <h2>New Class</h2>
    <p>Players can now play as the monk class. The monk class can be played by
    most races (goblins and worgen cannot be monks). The monk class has three
    specializations Brewmaster (tank), Mistweaver (Heal), Windwalker (dps).</p>

    <h2>Lore</h2>
    <h3>A Strange Land</h3>
    <p>At the beginning the Horde and Alliance had no idea what awaited them on
    Pandaria. However, each faction knows they want to conquer it for
    themsevles.</p>
    <h3>The Pandaren Problem</h3>
    <p>Both the Alliance and Horde wanted to win the hearts of the Pandaren, and
    so for most of the leveling quests players will help the Pandaren. After the
    Cataclysm many problems arose for them. The Mogu evil begins of the Titans
    began to rise up again under the command of the Thunder King, bent on taking
    Pandaria back from their former slaves the Pandaren. The Pandaren were also
    fighting an old enemy, the Sha. The Sha was created to help Pandaren fight
    the Mogu but realized it was too evil, and now they must fight it off, and
    not let it consume them.</p>
    <h3>Problems with the Horde</h3>
    <p>While the Alliance has its own struggles this expansion deals with a lot
    of conflict within the Horde. Garrosh Hellscream was appointed by Thrall to
    be the new Warcheif of the Horde after Thrall left to help repair the Earth.
    Garrosh decided that the Horde could and should conquer all of Azeroth. He
    sent a mana bomb upon Theramore (the alliance stronghold on Kalimdor),
    effectively destroying it. Taurens and Trolls, were even getting
    uncomfortable with Garrosh's actions. They in the Darkspear Rebellion in
    parallel with the Alliance worked to Take Garrosh down who was now causing
    havoc in Pandaria as well. Garrosh was captured and imprisoned, and Vol'jin
    leader of the Darkspear Trolls became the new Warcheif</p>
    <h3>Foreshadowing</h3>
    <p>While all thought that imprisoning Garrosh would be enough (even Varian
    Wrynn, King of the Alliance, who had the chance to kill Garrosh did not).
    Garrosh still have supporters in the Horde and with some dragons who helped
    escape to the past, to Draenor, where the Orcs are originally from</p>

    <h2>Raids</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><u>Heart of Fear</u>: The Sha of Fear has corrupted the grand empress of the
        mantid. Her increasingly erratic and paranoid commands have driven the
        Klaxxi--the keepers of mantid culture--to take aggressive action.
        Because they are few in number, the Klaxxi are reluctantly willing to
        accept outside help in destroying the empress and purging their race of
        the sha's negative influence.</li>
      <li><u>Mogu'shan Vaults</u>: The mogu, proud of their supremacy, kept lengthy
        records of their accomplishments within a great complex of vaults. The
        construction of these vast chambers predate any pandaren written
        records, shrouding their depths in mystery. Rumors once circulated of a
        mighty army locked within; for this reason, the vaults were the first
        target of the ancient pandaren rebellion, and they have been sealed ever
        since the mogu empire was overthrown.</li>
      <li><u>Siege of Orgrimmar</u>: The tensions stoked by Garrosh Hellscream's
        arrogance have reached a boiling point with the destruction unleashed
        upon the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. Leaders of the Alliance and Horde lay
        siege to Hellscream's capital in order to topple the ruthless Warchief
        once and for all!</li>
      <li><u>Terrace of Endless Spring</u>: Hidden high in the mountains, the Terrace
        of Endless Spring is the sacred center of the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.
        Its peaceful fountains are said to have the power to heal and
        rejuvenate, but when the Sha of Fear attacked, many of the complex's
        guardians turned on each other in fits of terror.</li>
      <li><u>Throne of Thunder</u>: When Pandaria separated from Kalimdor many thousands
        of years ago, a veil of mist kept outsiders from discovering the
        newly-formed continent. The mists also hid a reminder of an ancient
        evil: Lei Shen's Throne of Thunder. During his rule, this fortress was
        the seat of the Thunder King's power. Even after his death, great
        swathes of corrupted energy lingered, and now, the resurrected Thunder
        King and the Zandalari trolls intend to harness that energy to establish
        the reign of Lei Shen once again.</li>
