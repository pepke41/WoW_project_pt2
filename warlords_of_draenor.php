      <h2>Lore</h2>
      <h3>Garrosh's Escape</h3>
      <p>At the end of Mists of Pandaria Garrosh Hellscream was imprisoned by both
      Horde and Alliance and would stand trial in Pandaria for War Crimes both in
      Pandaria, on Theramore, the attempted assasination of Vol'jin and more.
      However, with the help of one of the Kairozdormu one of the Bronze Dragons
      he was able to escape to the past. Kairozdormu using a corrupted  Vision of
      Time was able to take Garrosh back to Draenor, the Orc homeworld before they
      left for Azeroth. Not only did the two return to Draenor they returned to a
      time where Garrosh's father Grommash Hellscream was still a young orc and
      chieftan of the Warsong Clan.</p>
      <h3>Garrosh Must be Stopped</h3>
      <p>Players will go back with a powerful group of Azeroth citizens. Among
      them are Khadgar the mage who will create the portal to Draenor and be
      intigral in stopping Garrosh. Players will also be joined by Thrall who
      takes some responsiblity for Garrosh's actions.</p>
      <h3>The Final Battle</h3>
      <p>Garrosh is finally found in Gorgorond. With Khadgar, Thrall and the
      others players will charge at Garrosh's forces. Once Garrosh is reached
      Thrall challenges Garrosh to a Mak'gora (an ancient orc duel of honor and
      fight to the death). In an epic battle Thrall is able to defeat Garrosh once
      and for all and his threat to Azeroth is no more.</p>

      <h2>Raids</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Highmaul</u>: Draenor is a savage land, birthplace of the orcish race yet
          named by draenei refugees hundreds of years ago. For generations, orcs,
          draenei, and the Gorian ogre imperium all coexisted, though not without
          strife and territorial skirmishes. Ancient and primal forces of creation
          and destruction clashed, maintaining equilibrium through violence. This
          is the world on which Garrosh awoke after his escape. And now, thanks to
          the Iron Horde and the dark hand of Gul'dan, the fate of two worlds
          hangs in the balance.</li>
        <li><u>Hellfire Citadel</u>: When Garrosh encouraged Grommash to begin
          construction of this massive stronghold at the heart of Tanaan Jungle,
          to serve as a staging ground for the assault of Azeroth, he even
          suggested the name Hellfire, pulled from a different time and a
          different land. He dreamed of seeing mighty orcish iron towering over an
          unblighted landscape, so very different from the wasteland he had known
          in Outland. But even as times change, so too do they stay the same.</li>
        <li><u>Blackrock Foundry</u>: This foundry was the ancestral home of the
          Blackrock orcs, wherein master smiths smelted and worked the impossibly
          hard ore that is the clan's namesake. Now, massive giants captured and
          broken by the Thunderlord heat the great forges, flamebenders of the
          Burning Blade imbue the ore with an inner fire, and engineers shape the
          slag according to otherworldly schematics. Warlord Blackhand's foundry
          is the center of the Iron Horde's military might, churning out the
          weaponry that will be used to raze Azeroth.</li>
      </ul>
