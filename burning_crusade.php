    <h2>Lore</h2>
    <h3>The Dark Portal</h3>
    <p>At the end of the original game the Dark Portal was opened by Lord
    Kazzak. Lord Kazzak opened the portal to the Outlands to join forces with
    Illidan Stormrage (who has taken demon blood to infiltrate their forces and
    destroy the legion) and his two partners Lady Vashj (Queen of the Naga) and Kael'thas
    Sunstrider (Blood Elf ruler). Unfortunately for Lord Kazzak and the rest of
    the Burning Legion the citizens of Azeroth followed the demons into the
    Outlands.</p>
    <h3>The Draenei Comes to Azeroth</h3>
    <p>When Illidan and his army came to Outlands, the draenei were lesss than
    happy. Illidan took some of the Draenei and mutated them to be apart of his
    army, however the rest of the Draenei decided to flee. They took the Exodar
    which was part of a Naaru ship and crash landed in Azeroth. Once in Azeroth
    the Draenei pledged their allegiance to the Alliance. The reason they chose
    the Alliance over the Horde is because of bad blood between the Draenei and
    the Orcs. Back on their homeworld Draenor the Orcs killed many Draenei.</p>
    <h3>The Blood Elves</h3>
    <p>Before Outlands the Blood Elves were members of the Alliance, however
    after the Draenei exposed what some Blood Elves and their leader, Kael'thas
    Sunstrider, were doing the Blood Elves were ostrasized from the Horde. The
    Blood Elves decided to take up arms with the Horde. However, even there they
    were viewed with suspicion by all but the Undead. Lady Sylvana's (Queen of
    the Undead) embraced them because she used to be their high elven queen.
    <h3>What awaits in Outlands</h3>
    <p>Illidan has been wreaking havoc in the Outlands, he has been rallying an
    amry of demon hunters, fel orcs (Orcs who were left behind in the exodus
    from Draenor to Azeroth), and enslaved Broken (Draenei who were left behind
    when the others escaped to Azeroth).</p>

    <h2>Raids</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><u>Karazhan</u>: Medivh, the Last Guardian, made his home in Deadwind Pass,
        in the bright tower of Karazhan. Though he was the greatest wizard of
        his day (and humanity's intended custodian) Medivh was secretly
        possessed by the dark spirit of Sargeras, the Destroyer of Worlds. Through
        Medivh, Sargeras opened the Dark Portal and allowed the orcs to wage war
        upon the kingdoms of Azeroth.</li>
      <li><u>Gruul's Lair:</u> When the infamous Dragon Aspect, Deathwing, discovered
        the Dark Portal and Draenor, he felt sure that few of Draenor's denizens
        would dare challenge the black dragonflight, so he scattered clutches of
        his eggs throughout the world.</li>
      <li><u>Magtheridon's Lair:</u> After the Legion came to Outland, Magtheridon
        controlled all but small pockets of Outland. Even so, he was taken
        largely by surprise when Illidan and his allies conquered the Black
        Temple. Many believed that Magtheridon had been slain in the attack,
        but, when Illidan discovered that Magtheridon's blood had a
        transformative, corrupting effect on orcs, the beaten pit lord was
        dragged to Hellfire Citadel.</li>
      <li><u>Serpentshrine Cavern:</u> These are the words of Lord Illidan Stormrage to
        his most trusted lieutenant, Lady Vashj. Shortly after the Third War,
        when Illidan requested the aid of the naga, a group of naga led by Lady
        Vashj answered his call. Ever since, Vashj has displayed a fierce
        dedication to Illidan. Now the naga witch carefully monitors Coilfang's
        operations from her seat of power within Serpentshrine Cavern. Far more
        at home here among the waters of the reservoir than locked within the
        cold stone walls of Black Temple, Vashj maintains a close eye on her
        minions and personally oversees the draining of Zangarmarsh. Whether her
        loyalties belong to Illidan alone, however, remains to be seen.</li>
      <li><u>The Eye (Tempest Keep):</u> The mighty Tempest Keep was created by the
        enigmatic naaru: sentient beings of pure energy and the sworn enemies of
        the Burning Legion. In addition to serving as a base of operations for
        the naaru, the structure itself possesses the technology to teleport
        through alternate dimensions, traveling from one location to another in
        the blink of an eye.</li>
      <li><u>The Battle of Mount Hyjal</u>: Deep within the Caverns of Time, the
        brooding dragon Nozdormu has awakened. Since the world was young, the
        bronze dragonflight has safeguarded the winding labyrinth, monitoring
        the shifting timeways to ensure that the delicate balance of time is
        upheld.</li>
      <li>The Black Temple: Long ago on Draenor, the Temple of Karabor was the
        center of draenei worship. But the devout priests who prayed there are
        long dead, slaughtered by marauding, demonically corrupted orcs. In the
        massacre's aftermath the warlocks of the Shadow Council seized the
        structure and bestowed upon it a new name: the Black Temple.</li>
      <li>Sunwell Plateau: For millennia the mystical pool of energy known as
        the Sunwell fueled the potent magic of the exiled high elves. Now, the
        remnants of this ancient fountain have become the Burning Legion's
        latest target as the demons prepare to summon their commander,
        Kil'jaeden, with the Sunwell's energy.</li>
