    <h1>World of Warcraft</h1>
    <p>World of Warcraft is MMORPG that was created in 2004.
    This page will give a brief introduction to the game, and what was
    available to a player in 2004. Each of the of the other tabs will
    focus on the following expansions. Also there is
    a page to vote and rank the WoW expansions. Enjoy!<p>
    <h2>Who and what could you play as in Vanilla?</h2>
    <p>The level cap in the original game was 60. Players could play as one
    of eight races, and choose one of nine classes. Not all classes are
    available to all races. Also in this expansion Horde only can play as a
    Shaman (all but Undead can be Shamans), and Alliance only can be
    paladins (Dwarves and Humans only).</p>

      <h2>Azeroth</h2>
      <img src="img/original_map.jpg" alt="original azeroth map">
      <p>While it will go through many changes through the expansions the Azeroth
      of the first game was restricted to the Eastern Kingdom and Kalimdor</p>
    </div>
    <div id="originalLore">
      <h2>Lore</h2>
      <h3>In the beginning...</h3>
      <p>The orc home world was falling apart so following a strange warlock the
      orc clans migrated to Azeroth. However, as they decided to make this their
      new home they encountered a new spieces the humans. Their struggle began
      the Horde and Alliance.</p>
      <h3>A Joining of Forces</h3>
      <h4>The Horde Unites</h4>
      <p>Lady Sylvanas Windrunner, The Banshee Queen, rulled over the undead.
        She decided to join forces with Thrall the current leader of the Orcs.
        After settling in Kalimdor the Orcs also encountered the Trolls led by
        Vol'jin and the Tauren, led by Cairne Bloodhoof. Together these four
        races united to create the original horde.</p>
      <h4>A Strong Alliance</h4>
      <p>Stormwind has previously been destroyed in battle, but now the humans
      were rebuilding their society and all the humans came under the rule of
      King Varian Wrynn. Knowing they needed help the humans reached out to
      their long time allies the Dwarves who joined the Alliance. With the
      Dwarves came the Gnomes. After their home Gnomergan had been toxified,
      they came to live in refuge of the drawven people. The Night Elves who
      had their home on Kalimdor seeing the horde as a threat decided to also
      ally themselves with the Alliance, they previously had an alliance with
      Lady Jaina Proudmoore who had now sworn to help King Varian Wrynn.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>More Dangers Come to Azeroth</h3>
    <p>Azeroth faced many perils. The Horde began to argue amoung themsevles,
    and the orcs suffered demon contamination. The forsaken (the undead under
    Lady Sylvanas) began to try and wipe out all living humans. The Trolls as
    well struggled amoung themselves fighting against those who called themselve
    "true Trolls". The Alliance also had their power struggles amoung the
    Dwarves there were three clans that struggled for control, and King Varian
    Wrynn had gone missing leaving Anduin, his young son, in charge.</p>
    <h3>What's next?</h3>
    <p>At the conclusion of the first World of Warcraft game Azeroth becomes
    exposed to the dark portal. The portal brought Lord Kazzak and the legion
    to take over Azeroth. Although the citizens of Azeroth would not take this
    lying down. The Horde and Alliance both worked to drive the legion from
    their home, leaving the dark portal open. With the dark portal open those
    brave enough could choose to explore a new realm the Outlands</p>
    <h2>Raids</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Zul'Gurub: Enter the ancient city of the Trolls to defeat Hakkar the
        Soulflayer and his minions, the priests and priestesses who tried to
        stop him and failed</li>
      <li>Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj: A thousand years ago the bronze dragon flight and
        the night elves joined together in the War of Shifting Sands to defeat
        the Qiraji and trap them behind a wall. However, now it has been
        realized that some are escaping. Those brave enough will join with the
        bronze dragons to defeat the Qiraji once and for all.</li>
      <li>The Molten Core: After the War of Three Hammers was won by the
        Bronzebeard Dwarven Clan, the Dark Iron Clan was banished and their
        leader Sorcerer-thane decided to take action. He decided summon a fire
        elemental that had been trapped by the Titans to wreak havoc on those
        who had deveated him. While he was not completely successful he did
        someone a fire beast, Ragnaros, who was trapped in the depths of the
        Moutain of the Molten Core. Now those brave enough will band together to
        banish Ragnaros back to the firelands.</li>
      <li>Blackwing Lair: Nefairan, son of Deathwing, decided he would take it
        upon himself to destroy Ragnaros once and for all. However, he also
        planned to take over Azeroth with his army of Blackrock Orcs. It is the
        job of the Horde and Alliance to stop him from succeeding.</li>
      <li>Onyxia's Lair: Onyxia like her brother Nefairan, has malicious
        purposes. She trieds to meddle in the affairs of what she considers to
        be the lesser races. To keep Azeroth safe she must be stopped.</li>
      <li>Temple of Ahn'Qiraj: The old god, C'thun has awaked from his slumber.
        He is beginning to regain his power and he must be stopped. Brave heroes
        must enter the temple and defeat C'thun.</li>
      <li>Naxxramas: Arguably the most difficult raid in the original WoW game.
        One of the Lich King's most powerful officers is wreaking havoc. Only
        the bravest and strongest can defeat Lich Kel'Thuzad.
