    <h1>Mists of Pandaria</h1>
    <p>After the Shattering and the defeat of Deathwing the Horde and Alliance
    are more at odds than ever, and now both are fighting to conquer the
    uncharted land of Pandaria. Pandaria is home to the Pandaren. In this
    expansion players will be able to level to 90, quest in Pandaria, and play
    as one new class, and play as one new races</p>
    <h2>New Race</h2>
    <p>Players can now play as one of the natives of Pandaria. Pandaren are
    different than the other races as they can be both Horde and Alliance. Once
    the player has gone through all of the Pandaren starter quests they can
    choose which faction they would like to join. Pandaren are the only race
    that cannot be a death knight.</p>
    <h2>New Class</h2>
    <p>Players can now play as the monk class. The monk class can be played by
    most races (goblins and worgen cannot be monks). The monk class has three
    specializations Brewmaster (tank), Mistweaver (Heal), Windwalker (dps).</p>
