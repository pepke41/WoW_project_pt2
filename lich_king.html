    <h1>Wrath of the Lich King</h1>
    <p>While the people of Azeroth were worried about the Burning Legion a new
    threat was arising in Northrend. The Lich King emerged from Icecrown Citadel
    ready to conquer Azeroth with his army of the Scourge. Players are now able
    to quest in Northrend and level up to 80.</p>
    <h3>New Classes</h3>
    <p>While there are no new races this expansion there is an exciting new
    class that can be played on any race, the Death Knight. Unlike all
    characters previously introduced in the game, when starting a Death Knight
    the player is automatically started at level 58. During the started quests
    players play under Arthas, The Lich King's rule, only to battle against him
    and his Scourge to join the Alliance or Horde at the end of the starter
    quest line. Death Knight can be played in Frost (dps), Unholy (dps), or

    <h2>Lore</h2>
    <h3>Who is the Lich King</h3>
    <p>The original Lich King was Ner'zhul, or a part of him. Ner'zhul was
    oroginally the leader of the Draenor orcs, but that changed when he
    encournterd one of the demon lords, Kil'jaeden. Ner'zhul tried to escape
    from the Burning Legion's hold, but Kil'jaeden did not let him escape and
    punished him with a fate worse than death. Kil'jaeden servered Ner'zhul's
    spirit from his body and his soul became the entity known as the Lich King.
    The Lich King was originally created to be a tool for the Burning
    Legion.</p>
    <h3>The New Lich King</h3>
    <p>Because the Lich King contained Ner'zhul's spirit it had a mind of its
    own, and eventually broke free of the Legion's control with the purpose of
    destroying Azeroth. Ner'zhul needed a body for his Lich King soul. Ner'zhul
    chose a human by the name of Arthas. Arthas ended up over powering Ner'zhul
    and effectively killing his spirit that remained in the Lich King entity,
    leaving just Arthas who know blamed complete Azeroth destructin</p>
    <h3>The Death Knight</h3>
    <p>Arthas needed an army and used his undead Scourge as that source. The
    Death Knight class is part of the army. In the early introductory quests
    players do Arthas's dirty work, killing the people of Northrend and them
    bringing them back as the Scourge. The players Death Knight after seeing
    these atrocities however, cannot continue to follow Arthas and so the player
    defects to help the Horde/Alliance battle against Arthas's army.</p>
    <h3>What awaits in Northrend</h3>
    <p>Players will enter Northrend either in the Howling Fjord (Horde) or the Borean
    Tundra (Alliance). From there they will fight back against the plague that
    Arthas has created.</p>
