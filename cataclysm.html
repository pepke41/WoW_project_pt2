    <h1>Cataclysm</h1>
    <p>All seems well in Azeroth until Deathwing an evil Dragon Aspect comes to
    shatter the world, and destroy Azeroth. Players will be able to level up to
    85 and explore six new regions (Mount Hyjal Vashj'ir, Deppholm, Uldum, and
    the Twilight Highlands). There are no new classes this expansion but there
    are two new races</p>
    <h2>Races</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Goblins (Horde)</li>
      <li>Worgen (Alliance)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Azeroth After The Shattering</h2>
    <img src="img/map_cata.jpg" alt="Azeroth map after Deathwing">
    <p>The swirl in the middle of the map is where the Earth was shattered by
    Deathwing, and how players can access the Deepholm Region to help the
    Earthen Ring and former Horde Warcheif Thrall repair the world</p>
    <h2>Lore</h2>
    <h3>A Long Time Ago</h3>
    <p>After the Old gods were locked away by the Titans and order was restored
    to Azeroth, the Titans created the five dragon aspects Nozdormu the brown,
    Alexstasza the red, Ysera the green, Malygos the Blue, and Neltharion the
    black. Each aspect would do their part to watch over Azeroth. However,
    problems arose when the Old Gods convinced Neltharion that he was the
    strongest dragon and should rule over all the others. The Old Gods helped
    Neltharion gain power, and with this power he became corrupted and tried to
    take over Azeroth. Neltharion now called Deathwing, was stopped by the
    people of Azeroth and imprisoned in Deepholm.</p>
    <h3>Deathwing returns</h3>
    <p>Over many years of being trapped in Deepholm Deathwing slowly began to
    regain his power. Eventually he was strong enough to escape from Deepholm in
    the middle of the Earth and again try to destroy Azeroth. Deathwings rise
    from Deepholm shook Azeroth to its core, and is known as the Shattering</p>
    <h3>New Members to the Horde and Alliance</h3>
    <h4>The Goblins</h4>
    <p>The Goblins are a technological group that for a long time were a part of
    Azeroth society and lived on the island of Kezan. Until now they were
    neither a part of the Horde or the Alliance. However, upon Deathwing's
    return from Deepholm, the Goblins of Kezan decided to flee to Kalimdor.
    While they were traveling they and a horde ship got attacked by an Alliance
    Fleet. Shipwrecked on the island the Goblins found Thrall (Former Warcheif
    of the Horde) and saved his life. When he and the Goblins returned to
    Kalimdor Thrall invited the Goblins to join the Horde, an invite which they
    accepted.</p>
    <h4>The Worgen</h4>
    <p>With Thrall gone his replacement Garrosh Hellscream decided that now was
    the time for Horde expansion and one region he tried to conquer was Gilneas,
    but the Gilneans were more than they appeared. Long ago the Gilneans were
    exposed to the worgen curse, turning them into werewolves. The worgen were
    able to fight off the Horde and were now exposed to the rest of Azeroth yet
    again. The night elves who had long ago also experienced the worgen curse
    decided to help the Worgen gain control of the werewolves powers and in time
    were welcomed to join the Alliance.</p>
    <h2>Raids</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Baradin Hold: Following the Second War, the ruined fortress of Baradin
        Hold on the remote island of Tol Barad was converted into a prison for
        some of the most dangerous forces on Azeroth. Yet with the devastation
        wrought by the Cataclysm, the prison's integrity has been compromised.
        Now as the Horde and Alliance vie for supremacy on the island, the
        liberation of its forgotten horrors may be at hand.</li>
      <li>Blackwing Decent: Nefarian and his warped attempts to create a new
        breed of dragon were thought to be defeated after his death in Blackwing
        Lair. Yet tales have emerged that his father, Deathwing, has reanimated
        Nefarian and set him to work in Blackwing Descent. The gruesome
        experiments being conducted there are feared to be on a level of
        wickedness far surpassing Nefarian's previous crimes against
        nature.</li>
      <li>Dragon Soul: Forged by Deathwing during the War of the Ancients, the
        Dragon Soul harnessed the combined power of the dragonflights until it
        was ultimately destroyed. Through the Caverns of Time, Thrall and the
        remaining dragonflights were able to recover the powerful artifact
        before its destruction. Now they have rallied at Wyrmrest Temple in a
        desperate attempt to use the might of the Dragon Soul against Deathwing
        himself.</li>
      <li>Firelands: The Firelands is the molten domain forged by the titans to
        house Ragnaros and his wayward minions. Following Deathwing's emergence
        into Azeroth, Ragnaros and his servants surged onto the slopes of Mount
        Hyjal before being driven back by the sacred mountain's valiant
        defenders. Now Ragnaros is rallying his loyalists to defend the
        Firelands from Azeroth's champions.<li>
      <li>Bastion of Twilight: The Bastion of Twilight stands as a dark symbol
        of the Old Gods' burgeoning power on Azeroth. Various branches of the
        Twilight's Hammer dwell deep beneath the towering form--considered the
        cult's foremost command center--along with their twisted leader,
        Cho'gall. There, he and his servants conspire to bring the Old Gods'
        apocalyptic visions to fruition by bleeding Azeroth of all sanity, hope,
        and life.</li>
      <li>Throne of the Four Wings: Al'Akir the Windlord's personal lair, the
        Throne of the Four Winds, glides high among Skywall's boundless vistas.
        Now that the barriers of the Elemental Plane have been ruptured, Al'Akir
        is free to travel Azeroth's winds at his leisure. He has mustered his
        fiercest tempests to scour Uldum of life and seize control of the
        mysterious titan-forged Halls of Origination.</li>
